Before migrating, make sure you are using the latest version of SJSF and
that you are not using any deprecated APIs.

## TL;DR

Update your `defaults.ts` file:

```diff
+ export { createFormMerger as createMerger } from "@sjsf/form/mergers/modern";

- import { createFormValidator } from "@sjsf/ajv8-validator";
-
- export const validator = createFormValidator();
+ export { createFormValidator as createValidator } from "@sjsf/ajv8-validator";
```

Yes, this change should be sufficient for migrating most projects.
However, I recommend reviewing the full list of changes,
as you might find opportunities to improve or simplify your current solution.

## New `createValidator` and `createMerger` form options

New options replace the `validator` and `merger` properties.

## Dependency versions have been updated

## All form options now can be reactive

## Fixed default values population behavior

## The `form.context` property has been removed

## Deprecated packages were removed

- `@sjsf/zod-validator`
- `@sjsf/daisyui-theme`
- `@sjsf/flowbite-theme`
- `@sjsf/shadcn-theme`
- `@sjsf/skeleton-theme`

You can use [overrides](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides)
to use these packages with v3.

## Etc.
