Before migrating, make sure you are using the latest version of SJSF and
that you are not using any deprecated APIs.

## TL;DR

Update your `defaults.ts` file:

```diff
+ export { createFormMerger as createMerger } from "@sjsf/form/mergers/modern";

- import { createFormValidator } from "@sjsf/ajv8-validator";
-
- export const validator = createFormValidator();
+ export { createFormValidator as createValidator } from "@sjsf/ajv8-validator";
```

Yes, this change should be sufficient for migrating most projects.
However, I recommend reviewing the full list of changes,
as you might find opportunities to improve or simplify your current solution.
