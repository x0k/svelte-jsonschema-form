## Feedback

You can leave feedback on any aspect of the library (features, documentation, etc.)
in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/x0k/svelte-jsonschema-form/discussions).

## Development

Personally, I use [nix](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_package_manager)
[dev](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.26/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-develop)
environment and [mk](https://github.com/x0k/mk), although `pnpm@10` will suffice
to perform any action.

### Dev server

To start the playground, you need to execute the following commands

```shell
pnpm i
pnpm build
cd apps/playground2
pnpm run dev
```

If you are working on a theme then you can run it dev server, example:

```shell
cd packages/basic
pnpm run dev
```

### Tests

You can run all tests from the root directory using the following command:

```shell
pnpm run test
```

Unfortunately, the library does not currently have good test coverage,
so contributions with tests are extremely welcome.

### Commit style

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
[scope] <description>
```

Scopes:
- Each package is a separate scope (e.g. package `skeleton3-theme` - `skeleton3` scope)
- The `form` package is divided into the following scopes:
  - `lib`
  - `core`
  - `form`
  - `fields`
  - `templates`
  - `translations`
  - `mergers`
- Scopes for changes affecting multiple packages of the same type
  - `themes`
  - `validators`
  - `examples`
- `build`

### Changes

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/tree/main), so
don't forget to [add](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md)
a `changeset` file using the `pnpm changeset` command.
