SJSF provides several ways of working with files.

## Data URL

When using `file` or `files` fields, the form automatically converts
uploaded files into Data URL strings.

**Advantages:**

- Easy-to-use format compatible with JSON Schema validators
- Files can be provided from the server (as initial values or when re-sending form data after a server-side validation error)

**Disadvantages:**

- Base64 encoding increases file size by about 30%
- Requires encoding/decoding steps to work with the actual file
- Some metadata is lost

You can use the `createDataURLtoBlob` and `fileToDataURL` functions
(available in both browser and server environments) from
the `@sjsf/form/lib/file` module to convert files to and from Data URLs.

## Native File

When using `native-file` or `native-files` fields, uploaded files are
represented directly as `File` objects.

**Advantages:**

- No encoding/decoding required
- File metadata is preserved

**Disadvantages:**

- Cannot be provided from the server
- May cause issues for JSON-oriented tools (e.g. JSON Schema validators)

### SvelteKit

With any file handling method, you must set `enctype="multipart/form-data"` on the form.

For native file handling, add the following `transport` hook in your `hooks.ts` file:

```ts
import type { Transport } from '@sveltejs/kit';

export const transport: Transport = {
  File: {
    encode: (v) => v instanceof File && 'file',
    decode: () => undefined
  }
};
```

## Preloading files

Another approach is to **preload files** into a storage backend as soon as the user selects them.
Instead of embedding file data in the form, the form value only stores a lightweight file identifier (ID).

This avoids the drawbacks of Data URLs and native `File` objects:
- Smaller payloads
- No `base64` overhead
- Files can be validated or processed on the server before submission
- Files can be provided from the server

See the [advanced example](../../examples/advanced/) `upload-file` for more information.

## Validation

SJSF provides several options for validating files.

### Custom keyword

The most flexible approach is to add a **custom JSON Schema keyword**.
This method works consistently on both the server and the client,
and the timing of validation can be controlled with the `fieldsValidationMode` option.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Form">
    <FormCard>
      <CustomKeywordForm client:only="svelte" />
    </FormCard>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="form.svelte">
    <Code code={customKeywordCode} lang="svelte" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

However, not all validators support custom keywords,
and file storage formats other than `File`
may require additional preprocessing before validation.

### FileList validator

Alternatively, you can implement the `AsyncFileListValidator` interface for your validator.
This validator runs **right after the user selects files,
but before the form state is updated**.

:::caution

If you use this validator, you must also implement equivalent validation on the server.

:::

A practical example is the `createFileSizeValidator` helper
from the `@sjsf/form/validators/file-size` module, which checks maximum file size.
Once this module is included, you can set the `maxFileSizeBytes` UI option on file fields.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Form">
    <FormCard>
      <FileSizeValidatorForm client:only="svelte" />
    </FormCard>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="form.svelte">
    <Code code={fileSizeValidatorCode} lang="svelte" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
