import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

import defaultsCode from '@/lib/form/defaults.ts?raw';

Even with a simple setup, resulting code is very verbose.
Therefore, it is convenient to create a file that re-exports the selected
resolver, theme, validator, merger and translation.

<Code code={defaultsCode} lang="typescript" title="lib/form/defaults.ts" />

And use it like this:

At the moment, Svelte has an [issue](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/17220)
with overwriting module properties used as component properties
(`<SimpleForm {...defaults} resolver={myResolver} >`) during SSR.

As a workaround, you can use a shallow clone of `defaults` object or
define `export const defaults = { ... }` in a `defaults` file.

```typescript
import * as defaults from '$lib/form/defaults'

const form = createForm({ ...defaults, <your-options> })
```
