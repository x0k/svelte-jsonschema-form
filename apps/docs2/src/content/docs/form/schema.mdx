Currently we only support [JSON Schema Draft-07](https://json-schema.org/draft-07#draft-07).

## String formats

Some string formats has special meaning:

- `date-time` - `datetime-local` input type
- `uri` - `url` input type
- `color`, `date`, `time`, `email` - corresponding input type
  - You can use `useDatePickerForDateFormat` function from
    `@sjsf/form/fields/extra-widgets/date-picker` to  use `datePickerWidget`
    for `date` format
- `data-url` - file field (with `compat` resolver)

## Details and limitations

- Library only supports local definition referencing. The value in the `$ref` keyword should be a [JSON Pointer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) in URI fragment identifier format.
- `$schema` keyword is ignored
- Some keywords are only involved in validation.
  - `contains`
  - `patternProperties`
  - `propertyNames`
  - `not`
- `exclusiveMaximum`, `exclusiveMinimum` are not currently passed to input elements.
- `writeOnly`, `contentMediaType` and `contentEncoding` has no special meaning.
- `additionalItems: true` will be treated as no additional items allowed.
- `additionalProperties: false` produces incorrect schemas when used with schema dependencies.
- Properties declared inside the `anyOf`/`oneOf` should not overlap with properties "outside" of the `anyOf`/`oneOf`.
- By default the `allOf` keyword uses [json-schema-merge-allof](https://github.com/mokkabonna/json-schema-merge-allof) to merge subschemas.
